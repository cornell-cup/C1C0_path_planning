# r2-path_planning

# Limitations:
1. Code will only work in controlled enviroment like:
   a. Having only static objects
   b. relatively small objects - less than 1.5 - 2 meters in width or length so that the robot will always have an opening to move       forward.   
 2. Robot will only care about sensor data when it is idle.
 
# Design Plan 
  (Subject to change)
1. The robot will move towards a voice while avoiding all the obstacles on the way
