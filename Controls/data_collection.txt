Set up a square with C1C0 in the center
Initial Data Collection:
  Apply .25*(max power) onto left motor, .75*(max power) onto right motor, record 
    end point
  Same procedure with left and right motor powers flipped
  Assume minimum power applied to a motor is .25, maximum is .75
  [left_motor_x      right_motor_x]  [left_motor_weight]
  [left_motor_y      right_motor_y]  [right_motor_weight]

  From the vectors obtained from testing, plug those into the matrix and that'll be the mapping

P_f = [.25] + .5*P_i
      [.25]

Motion = f(P_f)
We want to find P_i -> Motion
